# MinecraftVars

MinecraftVars is an object containing many methods that provide information about the player
and the world around them. However, unlike the other objects, most of MinecraftVars' methods
have built in javascript variable names. As such, you rarely need to directly use the
`MinecraftVars` object in your code - you can simply use the built in variable names.

## Provided Variables

> Some examples below

```javascript
// Play a sound if the player's health gets too low.
TriggerRegister.registerTick("checkPlayerHealth");
function checkPlayerHealth() {
  if (hp <= 4) {
    WorldLib.playSound("random.orb", 100, 1);
  }
}
```

> Using the server variables to register certain triggers

```javascript
TriggerRegister.registerWorldLoad("checkServer");
function checkServer() {
  var trigger = TriggerRegister.registerChat("privateMessage");

  if (server === "MyFavoriteServer") {
    // Register trigger for MyFavoriteServer
    trigger.setChatCriteria("&r&4${type} ${name}&r: ${message}");
  } else if (server === "SomeOtherServer") {
    // Register trigger for SomeOtherServer
    trigger.setChatCriteria("${type} &b${name} - &r${message}");
  }
}

function privateMessage(type, name, message, event) {
  event.setCanceled(true);
  if (type === "To") {
    ChatLib.chat("&5ME > " + name + "&r: " + message);
  } else if (type === "From") {
    ChatLib.chat("&5ME < " + name + "&r: " + message);
  }
}
```

Below is a list of all the provided variable names, a brief description, and an example
return value. Keep in mind, you can use these variables anywhere you want to in your
javascript code, as they are already defined

<aside class="notice">* These variables relate to the server the player is currently on. However, if the
player is in a single player world, they give fixed values. serverMOTD and server will both return
"SinglePlayer", serverIP will return "localhost", and ping will return 5.</aside>

> Using getTabsList()

```javascript
// Search the tabs list for a particular user, and if found, say hi to them
TriggerRegister.registerWorldLoad("playerSearch")
function playerSearch() {
  for (var item in MinecraftVars.getTabsList()) {
    if (item === "MyBestFriend") {
      ChatLib.say("Hello, MyBestFriend!");
    }
  }
}
```

<br>
Because the above javascript variables are updated every tick, some methods don't have provided variables. These methods are
ones that don't necessary need to be updated every tick, as their use will be limited. Currently, there is only one on this list.

Method Name | Description | Return value
------------|-------------|-------------
getTabsList() | Gets the player names listed in tab | An ArrayList of strings
